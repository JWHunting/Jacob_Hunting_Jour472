## About this lab

To complete this lab, you need to:
* write code in empty codeblocks provided to answer questions included (look for **Q**).
* write out the answer in the form of a complete sentence in the space given (look for **A**).

When you are finished, commit changes and push to your personal GitHub repo, then submit the URL to this document on ELMS.

## Load libraries and establish settings
**Task**: Load janitor and the tidyverse and sf

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(sf)

```

## Load data

```{r}

homicides <- read_rds("data/baltimore_homicides.rds")
demographics <- read_rds("data/baltimore_tract_demographics.rds")
shapefiles <- read_rds("data/baltimore_tract_shapefiles.rds")


```

You have been given two spatial dataframes and one regular dataframe to load.  The dataframes are:

* baltimore_homicides.rds | spatial | location and details about each Baltimore homicide between 2007 and 2017, including information about the status (open, closed with arrest, closed without arrest) and the exact location. Details on the data: https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides
* baltimore_tract_shapefiles.rds | spatial | polygons of each census tract in Baltimore
* baltimore_tract_demographics.rds | regular | the total population and white population of each baltimore Census tract in 2017.

**Task** Load the data

## Questions

**Q1** Are homicides that occur in majority white Census tracts in Baltimore solved at a higher rate than homicides in non-majority white Baltimore census tracts?
* Write up your findings in three paragraphs that could be dropped into a news story, with the answer to the question as the lede.
* Include any other relevant details.
* Output a table with relevant results.
* Output at least one map visualization pertinent to your finding.

**A1**


```{r}

  geom_sf(data=shapefiles) +
  geom_sf(data=homicides)

  mutate(pct_white = white_pop/total_pop) %>%
  mutate(neighborhood_type = case_when(
    pct_white > .50 ~ "majority white",
    TRUE ~ "non majority white"))
```




```{r}

  inner_join(shapefiles) %>%
  st_as_sf() %>%
  st_join(homicides) %>%

```





```{r}

  count(neighborhood_type, disposition) 

dispos_balt_maj_white_geo <- dispos_balt_maj_white_geo %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from=disposition, values_from=n) %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  mutate(total = closed_by_arrest+closed_without_arrest+open_no_arrest) %>%
  mutate(unsolved = open_no_arrest + closed_without_arrest) %>%
  mutate(pct_unsolved = unsolved/total*100)

```





#Calculation broken down by case

#Closed by Arrest
  #pct of cases closed by arrest in majority white neighborhoods: 128/239= 54%
  #pct of cases closed by arrest in non majority white neighborhoods: 874/2588= 34%

#Closed without Arrest
  #pct of cases closed without arrest in majority white neighborhoods: 15/239= 6%
  #pct of cases closed without arrest in non majority white neighborhoods: 137/2588= 5%

#Open, No Arrest
  #pct of cases left opened no arrest in majority white neighborhoods: 96/239= 40%
  #pct of cases left opened no arrest in non majority white neighborhoods: 1577/2588= 61%
```{r}
sum(dispos_balt_maj_white_geo$total)= 2827
sum(dispos_balt_maj_white_geo$unsolved) =1825

Story

Homicides in Baltimore is an issue that has surrounded the city's image for years and conversations are often had about the cross sections between race, violence and policing in the city. According to data from The Washington Post homicides are closed by an arrest on 34% of the time in non-majority white neighborhoods. 

In comparison, the same detectives closed cases by arrest at 54% in majority-white neighborhoods and only left 40% open with no arrest. In majority non white communities that number is 61% representing 1577 homicides from 2007-2017 according to the data.

Using the data a map of the homicides in Baltimore during that time period can be produced and the dots of homicides resemble the "Black Butterfly" that is often referenced in talking about the city's racial diversity. The map shows a concentration of homicides in the areas of the “wings” where a majority of the non-majority-white neighborhoods lie.
